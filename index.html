        <p>At any given elementary school, “Milo Imagines the World” is exactly the kind of children’s book you could imagine being in high demand during free reading time.</p>

        <p>The 40-page, charmingly-illustrated book centers on a young boy who, on a long subway ride, draws the places he imagines his fellow passengers will go once they reach their stops. The lesson? Readers should let their imagination run wild, not their judgment.</p>

        <p>Instead, the seemingly innocuous picture book became a source of controversy at one school district in Florida, as parents in Pinellas County raised concerns over its content, along with other books like “Ambitious Girl,” a best-selling children’s book about young female empowerment.</p>

        <p>That’s when Raegan Miller, the parent of an eighth grade daughter and fifth grade son in the district, decided to fight back.</p>

        <p>Miller reached out to the directors of the Florida Freedom to Read Project, an organization created by two moms in the Orlando area, who, like Miller, were alarmed by the rise in the number of books being pulled from the shelves of school libraries and classrooms around the state.</p>

        <p>Not long after the group's founding, Miller — an accountant by day — became the director of development and finance for the group, which monitors school board meetings across the state and files public records requests with the help of an army of volunteers across the Sunshine State.</p>

        <p>The group also uses its Twitter account — which boasts more than 14,000 followers — as a megaphone to fight what it believes to be censorship attempts, levied on spurious grounds by parents and community members.</p>

        <p>“When you go through and look at their challenges and see why they're mad about it, it's almost amusing,” said Miller. “If they weren't actually removing books from school, it would be really amusing.”</p>

        <p>In 2021, there were four times as many book challenges nationwide compared to 2020, a trend that has raised alarms among free speech organizations. Amid the national debate over the role that parents should play in deciding what content is allowed in the classroom, Florida has become a leader in book bans. (The nonprofit free speech organization PEN America defines a book ban as, "any action taken against a book based on its content," by parents, community groups, or politicians.)</p>

        <p>Florida accounted for almost one-fourth of book bans across the country, between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022, according to an analysis of the 2,532 book bans indexed nationwide by PEN America.</p>

        <p>The state’s own leader, Governor Ron DeSantis, who is expected to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/desantis-skip-exploratory-committee-team-begins-debate-prep/story?id=99117695">announce his bid</a> for the presidency this summer, has seen his profile rise as the number of book bans has accelerated in the state. Along with the Republican-led legislature, DeSantis has passed legislation like House Bill 1467, which gives parents greater latitude to challenge instructional materials that are "pornographic" or "inappropriate for the grade level and age group for which the material is used."</p>

        <p>Advocates for the legislation say it allows parents to exert greater control over what their children learn, particularly over content they might deem inappropriate. Critics say the laws have turned library shelves from a place of discovery and imagination into a miasma of confusion for administrators, librarians, teachers, and students alike.</p>

        <p>That is, if there are any books on the shelves at all.</p>

        <p>The laws have forced many districts to remove books from classrooms and libraries until they can be reviewed by media specialists. Violation of the law could be punishable by a third-degree felony, which is punishable by up to five years in prison.</p>

        <p>In February, a substitute teacher in the Jacksonville area was <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/02/19/florida-teacher-who-posted-video-showing-empty-bookshelves-in-school-library-gets-fired/">fired</a> after he posted a video to Twitter showing rows of empty bookshelves in the school’s library. DeSantis <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epzjbn/florida-teacher-fired-for-viral-video-library-desantis">called</a> the video a “fake narrative.”</p>

        <p>“I spoke to a teacher last night who was telling me that even in their media center, they have tons of books just removed right now,” said Miller.</p>

        <p>Books featuring LGBTQ+ characters, storylines, and themes as well as books about race have been targeted in particular. Of the 35 most-banned books in school libraries across the country, 21 of them centered on themes of gender and sexuality or featured LGBTQ+ characters and storylines.</p>

        <p>“What it's causing is the most conservative voice to be the loudest, because they're saying okay, well, if an LGBTQ+ character gets me in trouble, of course, I'm gonna remove all my books,” said Miller.</p>

        <iframe title="Race, LGBTQ+ Stories a Particular Target of Book Bans" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-qB8Ef" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qB8Ef/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="461" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

        <p>Miller said the rash of book bans across the country has been led by conservative groups like Moms for Liberty, which advocates for parental control over school curriculum.</p>

        <p>Such groups have played a role in influencing legislatures in other states like Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas to pass similar laws to the ones in Florida. Together, the four states were responsible for over 85% of the book bans between the period cataloged by PEN America.</p>

        <p>Still, while the number of book bans has increased dramatically over the last few years, library accessibility is not as contentious in other states across the country. Between the same period, there were 14 states in which there were 10 or fewer recorded book bans, and 18 states did not register a single book ban. Polling has consistently shown that a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-dont-want-books-banned-but-theyre-divided-over-what-schools-teach/">majority</a> of Americans oppose book bans.</p>

        <p>And of the 138 school districts which recorded at least one ban across the country, just six were responsible for two-thirds of all bans.</p>

        <p>But in Florida, Miller says her daughter, an eighth grader, and son, a fifth grader, are seeing first-hand the effects that the legislation is having on the accessibility of books in their library, having been unable to check out books that were not deemed “age appropriate” for their grade level.</p>

        <p>“With literary rates dropping, how do you meet kids when you can’t provide them [with] a wide array of books to read?” asked Miller.</p>

        <p>While the bans have mostly affected elementary and middle schools, Miller — who attended Florida State, an institution that she called one of her “true loves in life” — worries about the chilling effect that attitude surrounding book bans could have on higher education in the state.</p>

        <p>“I would strongly advise my children not to attend either of those schools, in this political climate I would want them to go somewhere where people are allowed to be more free thinkers,” said Miller.</p>
